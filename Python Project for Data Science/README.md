# Python Project for Data Science

## Abstract:
This study investigates the historical stock performance and revenue trends of two companies, Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME). Utilizing Yahoo Finance and web scraping techniques, we collected historical stock price data and revenue data for Tesla and GameStop. Our analysis aims to provide insights into the relationship between stock performance and revenue generation for these companies.

## Introduction:
Understanding the relationship between a company's revenue and its stock performance is crucial for investors and analysts alike. In this study, we focus on two prominent companies in the technology and gaming industries: Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME). Tesla, renowned for its electric vehicles and renewable energy products, represents innovation in the automotive sector. On the other hand, GameStop gained widespread attention due to the volatility in its stock price driven by retail investor activity in early 2021.

The aim of this research is to analyze historical data on stock prices and revenue for Tesla and GameStop, seeking correlations and trends that may shed light on their financial performance and market behavior. By examining these data sets, we aim to provide valuable insights for investors and analysts interested in understanding the dynamics between revenue generation and stock valuation.

## Methods and Materials:
We utilized Python programming language and various libraries to gather and analyze data for this study. The key steps involved in our methodology are outlined below:

* Data Collection:
    - We employed the Yahoo Finance API to retrieve historical stock price data for Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME).
    - Additionally, we utilized web scraping techniques with the BeautifulSoup library to extract revenue data from specific webpages for both companies.
* Data Preprocessing:
    - After collecting the data, we performed preprocessing steps such as cleaning and formatting to ensure consistency and accuracy.
    - This included removing unnecessary characters, converting data types, and handling missing values.
* Data Analysis:
    - We conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize the trends in stock prices and revenue over time.
    - Statistical analysis techniques were applied to identify correlations and patterns in the data.
* Visualization:
    - Visual representations, including line graphs and scatter plots, were generated using Plotly library to illustrate the relationship between stock prices and revenue.

## Discussion:
The analysis of historical stock price and revenue data for Tesla and GameStop revealed interesting insights into the financial dynamics of these companies.

For Tesla, a notable observation was the positive correlation between revenue growth and stock price appreciation. As Tesla's revenue increased over time, particularly in recent years, its stock price exhibited an upward trend, reflecting investor confidence in the company's performance and future prospects. The surge in revenue from various sources, including vehicle sales and energy products, contributed to Tesla's market dominance and sustained growth trajectory.

In contrast, GameStop's revenue trend exhibited more volatility, with fluctuations influenced by factors such as changes in consumer behavior and the evolving gaming industry landscape. Despite sporadic spikes in revenue, particularly during periods of high-profile game releases, GameStop's stock price experienced considerable volatility, driven by external factors such as short-seller activity and retail investor sentiment.

The visualizations presented in this study further highlight the relationship between revenue and stock price movements, providing a comprehensive overview of the financial performance of Tesla and GameStop.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the relationship between revenue generation and stock performance for Tesla and GameStop. By analyzing historical data and leveraging data visualization techniques, we identified trends and correlations that contribute to a deeper understanding of the financial dynamics within these companies.

The findings underscore the importance of revenue growth as a fundamental driver of stock price appreciation, particularly in the case of Tesla, where sustained revenue expansion has bolstered investor confidence and market valuation. Additionally, the study highlights the significance of monitoring revenue trends and market sentiment for informed investment decisions, especially in industries characterized by rapid technological advancements and evolving consumer preferences.

Overall, this research contributes to the body of knowledge surrounding financial analysis and investment strategies, offering valuable insights for investors, analysts, and stakeholders interested in the performance of Tesla, GameStop, and similar companies operating in dynamic market environments.
