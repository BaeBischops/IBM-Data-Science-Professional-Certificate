# Content Based Recomender System
Hello there! In this repository, I've compiled information and Python code samples to understand and implement various machine learning algorithms for classification and regression tasks. Let's dive in.

## Types of Machine Learning Algorithms and Their Applications
### Supervised Learning
* Regression: Used when the output is a continuous value, such as predicting prices or quantities.
* Classification: Ideal for predicting discrete categories, like spam or not spam, or identifying types of flowers based on their features.
### Unsupervised Learning
* Hierarchical Clustering: Suitable for grouping data into clusters that have a nested relationship.

## Linear Classification Methods Comparison
I've included a detailed comparison of the following linear classification methods:
* Multiclass Prediction: Used for classifying instances into one of multiple classes.
* Support Vector Machines (SVM): Effective for both regression and classification tasks, especially when dealing with complex datasets.
* Logistic Regression: Great for binary classification problems and probability estimation.

## Evaluating Regression Results
I've also included Python code to evaluate the results from simple linear, non-linear, and multiple regression on a given dataset using evaluation metrics.
